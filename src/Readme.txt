>>>FAQ

Q01. How do I add stocks to the rotation?

A.	You may add stocks to the extension via the Edit menu, which can be opened
   many ways. One of which is to open it by navigating the menu
   Via: Tools -> StockFox -> Edit...      Then type the the stock symbol into the 
   textbox, and click "Add Symbol". If you do not know the symbol of the stock you 
   wish to add, click on the Symbol Lookup link to open up a website that you can 
   search for your stocks on.


Q03. How can I get my stocks to scroll across as a toolbar?

A.	You can turn on the toolbar in your browser by navigating the menu 
   Via: View -> Toolbars -> StockFox Toolbar


Q04. How can I edit my own personal holdings?

A.	You can edit your holdings (once you've added the stock to the list) in the
   holdings sidebar. This can accessed by pressing F9, or by navigating the menu 
   Via: View -> Sidebar -> StockFox   then double click a stock entry, or, click on
   it once and then select the "Edit Holding" button.



>>>TROUBLESHOOTING

T01. My toolbar has frozen/stopped scrolling.

A.	If you run into any trouble with the toolbar, it might be necessary to
   restart your browser in order to fix it. If possible, please email me (my email
   is located up at the top of this file) the circumstances under which it has
   frozen for you, so that I can fix the problem for future versions.

T02. The animation on my toolbar isn't smooth.

A.	Unfortunately, the animation isn't as ideal as I'd like it to be. I hope to
   find a better implementation in the future. In the meantime, If the scrolling 
   text pauses when one of the stocks fades out, try increasing the toolbar scroll 
   speed in the edit menu.
